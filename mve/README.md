### MVE (Minimal Value Experiment)

The point of this experiment is to define the minimal basic specs of a Synthetix-like system and implement it with various architectures. The goal is to (a) get a feel for developing in each architecture beyond a basic poc, and (b) measure gas costs with each architecture.

#### Specification

TODO

#### Architectures

##### No-proxy

Contracts: `contracts/no-proxy/`

Minimal implementation of the specification with no upgradeability and the most basic possible module system.
